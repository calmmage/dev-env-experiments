# Inbox
Here I write down ideas for what I need to do

# Workalong
Here I select specific things and do them

## Step 1
- [x] commit current state

## Step 2
- [x] Apply current nix configuration. 

1. Create build-nix.sh script
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x build-nix.sh`
3. Run: `./build-nix.sh`

open nix folder in terminal

## Step 3
My custom aliases

Idea: add my custom .zshrc / aliases to the nix config
Caveat:
I want them to be stored as separate files so that I could easily see what's in them and also edit them

Plan:
- download them from my repo. Put into current folder
- ask gpt how to have them as separate files

## Step 4

a) do some quick solutions right now that I need
b) plan what to add later

a)
- [x] aliases
- [x]zshrc

b) 
launchd -> jobs
raycast -> extensions, scripts
python startup (for jupyter)
python tools (from my devenv repo)
run with poetry
