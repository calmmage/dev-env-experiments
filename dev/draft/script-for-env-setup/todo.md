# what is my goal?

- Goal is to be able to run python scripts with simple aliases.

How do I want to achieve this?
- script that sets everything up:
  - copies main libs (clones)
  - creates main poetry env, saves its path
  - ... creates env variable 
- shell env variables - to python env executable and calmlib / dev-env / etc roots
- alias to run (script) with (python)
- alias for specific command
