# ideas
## back-populate seasonal dirs? 
a) just clone repos and put them in the seasonal dirs by creation date
b) look into specific old patterns I worked in and extract particular items based on that
- latest: dev/draft structure
- look at migration folder. Sort manually
- Will i have to back-populate seasonal repos as well?
