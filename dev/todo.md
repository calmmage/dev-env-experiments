# More Ideas

## 
Main directions
- [x] Copy old calmmage_dev_env from calmmage/calmmage to calmmage/dev_env

how the new system would work
## Update project folder structure
- Observation: I'm not using all the folders there, it's not convenient.
So, instead, I want to have just a few main folders:

/work/projects - all projects
- calmmage_private project for all the one-off items. It has 'seasonal' folder structure
- examples project

what else?
Do I want to keep seasonal and structured dirs?
