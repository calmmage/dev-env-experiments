# Idea
well, to be honest I am open to suggestions

I want to have some kind of flexible configuration.
For example, flake, if I run it in pre-commit - blocks the commit.

Instead, I'd like to just get a report on code quality without it being blocking

Or maybe like if quality is too low - block, but else pass
Same for vulture
And for codecov

# What GPT did
- gpt created a custom script with code quality report

That does what I want, but not exactly what I had in mind... also I'll have to add it to all repos. 

Need to think of another way
